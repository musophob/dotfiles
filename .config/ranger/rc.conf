# ===================================================================
# This file contains the default startup commands for ranger.
# To change them, it is recommended to create the file
# ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf and add your custom commands there.
#
# If you copy this whole file there, you may want to set the environment
# variable RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC to FALSE to avoid loading it twice.
#
# The purpose of this file is mainly to define keybindings and settings.
# For running more complex python code, please create a plugin in "plugins/" or
# a command in "commands.py".
#
# Each line is a command that will be run before the user interface
# is initialized.  As a result, you can not use commands which rely
# on the UI such as :delete or :mark.

# ===================================================================

# Which files should be hidden? (regular expression)
# set hidden_filter ^\.|\.(?:pyc|pyo|bak|swp)$|^lost\+found$|^__(py)?cache__$

# Open all images in this directory when running certain image viewers
# like feh or sxiv?  You can still open selected files by marking them.
# set open_all_images true

# Be aware of version control systems and display information.
set vcs_aware true

# State of the four backends git, hg, bzr, svn. The possible states are
# disabled, local (only show local info), enabled (show local and remote
# information).
# set vcs_backend_git enabled
set vcs_backend_svn enabled

# Use one of the supported image preview protocols
set preview_images true

# Set the preview image method. Supported methods:
#
# * w3m (default):
#   Preview images in full color with the external command "w3mimgpreview"?
#   This requires the console web browser "w3m" and a supported terminal.
#   It has been successfully tested with "xterm" and "urxvt" without tmux.
#
# * iterm2:
#   Preview images in full color using iTerm2 image previews
#   (http://iterm2.com/images.html). This requires using iTerm2 compiled
#   with image preview support.
#
#   This feature relies on the dimensions of the terminal's font.  By default, a
#   width of 8 and height of 11 are used.  To use other values, set the options
#   iterm2_font_width and iterm2_font_height to the desired values.
#
# * urxvt:
#   Preview images in full color using urxvt image backgrounds. This
#   requires using urxvt compiled with pixbuf support.
#
# * urxvt-full:
#   The same as urxvt but utilizing not only the preview pane but the
#   whole terminal window.
set preview_images_method iterm2

# Which colorscheme to use?  These colorschemes are available by default:
# default, jungle, snow, solarized

# Preview files on the rightmost column?
# And collapse (shrink) the last column if there is nothing to preview?
# set preview_files true

# This helps to synchronize bookmarks between multiple ranger
# instances but leads to *slight* performance loss.
# When false, bookmarks are saved when ranger is exited.
set autosave_bookmarks false

# Use fuzzy tab completion with the "cd" command. For example,
# ":cd /u/lo/b<tab>" expands to ":cd /usr/local/bin".

# Avoid previewing files larger than this size, in bytes.  Use a value of 0 to
# disable this feature.
set preview_max_size 104857600 # 100MB
